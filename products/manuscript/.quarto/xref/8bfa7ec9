Pre-vaccine titers were considered the placebo group titers and post-vaccine titers were considered the vaccine group titers. Pre- and post- vaccine titers were mapped to predicted protection probabilities using the model defined by Coudeville et al. These protection probabilities were then converted to risk probabilities (1-Protection), summed, and pre- and post-vaccine group risks were compared via ratio to achieve an estimated vaccine efficacy. These methods were applied to both H1N1 and H3N2 titers in all seasons, but only H1N1 titers for the 2018-2019 season are shown here."},{"key":"eq-rive","order":{"section":[3,3,0,0,0,0,0],"number":4},"caption":""},{"key":"tbl-one","order":{"section":[4,1,0,0,0,0,0],"number":1},"caption":"Data overview showing vaccine strains for each season (influenza A only), sample size and age ranges for the three populations we analyzed.
