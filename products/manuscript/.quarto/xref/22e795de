Pre- and post- vaccine titers were mapped to predicted protection probabilities using the model defined by Coudeville et al [@coudeville2010b]. These protection probabilities were then converted to risk probabilities (1-Protection), summed, and pre- and post-vaccine group risks were compared via ratio to achieve an estimated vaccine efficacy. Pre-vaccine titers were used to represent an unvaccinated (placebo) group. These methods were applied to both H1N1 and H3N2 titers in all seasons, the diagram shows H1N1 titers for the 2018-2019 season as example.
